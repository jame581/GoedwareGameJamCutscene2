This project is our submission for  GoedWare Game Jam Cutscene 2 Edition game jam, created using Godot. Theme of game jame **FIVE SECONDS TOO LATE**.

**The game is available on itch.io. Play it here:** https://hubacekjakub.itch.io/quest-stop-the-ritual

## Game description

Every hero needs an epic entrance - but timing is everything.

Our take on the theme focuses on a funny hero buildup where the "legendary arrival" happens just a little too late to be useful. We wanted to lean into the comedic contrast between a grand cinematic introduction and the awkward reality of missing the mark.

The Concept: A humorous, cinematic look at missed cues and failed timing.
